Stretch Questions

    - It is possitioned closest to the nearest element prior to it.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    - Use ,display: inline-block;
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default?
    - <p> <div> and <nav> are block by default.  <span> and <a> are inline by default.  <img> is inline-block by default.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    - The box model is the invisible frame around all elements going from the middle which is the content, then padding around the text for example, then the border around that and then the margin around this.  The fix is the box sizing: border-box line in css.
